# hello-world
My first repository

Hello Fellow Humans,

I'm trying to learn git-hub to make some personal projects with Python andd add it to my resume. Where I live (Mexico) this is still not used but I saw in many YouTube videos that this is the normal in the US, so I'm trying to implement this by myself to step up a notch from my fellows coders to stand out.

Thanks for reading this! I don't know who would but thanks! haha

BYE!

Hi, this is a changed made in linux!
